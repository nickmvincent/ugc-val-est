<p>As you can see, every other column is of the type  or could be  or even  etc.</p>

<p>As it's defined by the beans with the PropertyValueFactory:</p>

<pre><code>emailCol.setCellValueFactory(
        new PropertyValueFactory&lt;Person, String&gt;("email"));
</code></pre>

<p>However, the first column you don't just one pass an information of the person as the class Person doesn't have any index or other number. So when you create the number column as:</p>

<pre><code>TableColumn&lt;Person, Person&gt; numberCol = new TableColumn&lt;Person, Person&gt;("#");
</code></pre>

<p>You are creating a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta" rel="nofollow">meta</a>" column and by that you are using persons to create the elements of such column (as you can see you get the index of the person to fill it). In fact the column have Persons, but its purpose is to have a column which will complete information that aren't exactly from the class Person but is relevant to be in the table. </p>
