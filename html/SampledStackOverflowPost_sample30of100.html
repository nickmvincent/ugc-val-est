<p>Most php frameworks (CodeIgniter, Laravel, etc.) provide a cross-site request forgery token implementation. This is a generated hash you store in your page (in a JS variable or hidden input field). You send the CSRF token back to the server with your register POST request. If the token doesn't match, the request is denied. The key here is that you not set a static token (as your question assumes) but you generate and serve it with the initial page request. Look into the documentation for the PHP framework you're using or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery</a></p>
