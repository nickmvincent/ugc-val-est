<p>SDL + OpenGL. Maybe also <a href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLee/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glee</a> or <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glew</a> if you use shaders and/or extensions.
Glee is easier to use, but it looks like it doesn't support OpenGL versions after 3.0.
Also you might need <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SDL_image</a> for loading images.</p>

  <p>I know there's OpenGL, but I can't seem to find any tutorials on how to use it in a cross platform manner, they all focus on one platform.</p>

<pre><code>    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_RED_SIZE, 8);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_GREEN_SIZE, 8);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_BLUE_SIZE, 8);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER, 1);
    SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_SWAP_CONTROL, 0);//disable vsync

    if (SDL_SetVideoMode(scrWidth, scrHeight, 32, SDL_OPENGL) == 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "couldn't set mode %dx%d!\n", 640, 480);
        SDL_Quit();
        return -1;
    }
    glewInit();//if you use glew, shaders, extensions.

    while(gameIsRunning()){//game loop
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
        //OpenGL rendering here 
        glFlush();
        SDL_GL_SwapBuffers();       
    }
    SDL_Quit();

  <p>Using SDL is also a possibility, but I'm afraid the game may not perform as well if I use it. Is this necessarily true?</p>

<p>With vsync disabled, you can get from few hundreds to thousand frames per second. Exact performance depends on your hardware and scene complexity - I had 300 fps reports for simple 3D dungeon crawler that used "RAW" opengl without display lists/vertex buffer objects. Also, if you use fixed framerate or timer-driven engine, you won't get more frames per second than you asked for.</p>

<p>SDL was used for porting Unreal 2004 to Linux. It also was used in Doom 3/Quake 4 linux port. So it is thoroughly tested and well known.</p>
