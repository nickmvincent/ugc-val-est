<a<p><code>map</code> does not use hashing.  It can't, because the constraints do not require hashable keys.  It is ordinarily implemented as a binary search tree, sorted by key.  Thus, it requires keys be &lt;-comparable</p>

<p>In contrast, C++0x will provide an ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unordered_map_%28C%2B%2B%29" rel="nofollow"><code>unordered_map</code></a>, which does use hashing.</p>

<p>If you want specific help, you should tell us what code you've tried so far, and which examples you don't understand.</
