<p>You don't need truth tables to learn Ruby, though they're not that hard, they look scarier than they are.</p>

<p>To learn what this tutorial is trying to teach you, go to the command line and type <code>irb</code> which will open up an interactive Ruby for you, called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" rel="nofollow">REPL</a>. You can play around with the boolean expressions, which just means code that deals with true and false:</p>

<pre><code>1.9.3-p0 :001 &gt; true || false
 =&gt; true 
1.9.3-p0 :002 &gt; (true || false) &amp;&amp; false
 =&gt; false 
1.9.3-p0 :003 &gt; false &amp;&amp; true
 =&gt; false 
1.9.3-p0 :004 &gt; false ^ true
 =&gt; true 
1.9.3-p0 :005 &gt; !true
 =&gt; false 
1.9.3-p0 :006 &gt; !!true
 =&gt; true
1.9.3-p0 :007 &gt; exit
</code></pre>

<p>Whatever they're trying to teach you with truth tables, you can learn better with a little experimentation in an interactive environment.</p>
