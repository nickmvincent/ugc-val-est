<p>You're looking for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Distributed Revision Control</a>, system such as Git, Bazaar, or Mercurial.</p>

<p>I personally like Bazaar because it has good windows support.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mercurial</a> may be the best choice in your case, as it seems to have a Visual studio plugin.  It does have a web interface and ssh support, which are probably better options than email, but there is also an extension that allows patches via email.</p>
