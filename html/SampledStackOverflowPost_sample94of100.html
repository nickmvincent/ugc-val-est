<p>Your code fragment is what in <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007124" rel="noreferrer">Head First Design Patterns</a> is called "The Simple Factory" (p. 117).<br/>
The main difference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern" rel="noreferrer">Factory Method Pattern</a> is the <i>ConcreteCreator</i> (compare the diagram in the upper right corner), which is a simple class in your case. <br/>In the "real pattern" the factory class is abstract with an abstract factory class. So, there is one more abstraction level. However, for many use cases, your <i>Simple Factory</i> is enough.</p>
