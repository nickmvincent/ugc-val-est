<a<p>It seems that your xml file starts with the UTF-8 byte-order-mark (see ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Probably happened when you copied the declaration. The solution depends on the editor you're using, some of them can be set not to write the BOM. Sometimes it disappears when you delete the first character of the file and type it again.
