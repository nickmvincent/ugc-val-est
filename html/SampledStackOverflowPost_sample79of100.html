<a<p>In basic terms, Javascript is used primarily to make web pages more interactive, AFTER a web page has been loaded into the web browser. Javascript is a client side programming language.  In this case, client means random people surfing the Internet with Internet Explorer, or Firefox, etc...  There are other uses for Javascript, but this is the most common use.</p>

<p>PHP on the other hand, is a server side programming language that allows for the creation of dynamic web pages.  In this case, dynamic meaning that the content of the pages have context, either in regards to actions and settings of a specific user(guy surfing the web) or relevant to the type of content that a website provides, such as a News website that always has new News articles.  Often you will see these two things intermingled to provide each user with a customized and dynamic experience each time they use a website. These pages, while dynamic, aren't dynamic in the same way that javascript can be, because the client(web browser) has to send a request to the server every time it needs more information and that request leads to the web browser needing to load a new web page. </p>

<p>The dynamic part of Javascript comes from it being able to respond to the user's actions without requesting more information from the server or by requesting a very small amount of informaiton from the server and not causing the entire web page to reload.  While this a good thing, it is limited.  Because Javascript is a client side programming language, it is not secure, meaning that if your server needs to save or use any data touched by Javascript, it should be sanitized(inspected and possibly modified) before it can be trusted.  This is true of information that is submitted through regular HTML forms as well. Javascript is also limited by data size factors since a large and complex website, if created using just Javacript, would require a ton of information to be loaded all at once and that doesn't work well for websites because people expect them to load quickly.  Also, if you intend to use a database, client side Javascript has no options for you.  PHP on the other hand can work with databases pretty easily.</p>

<p>All that said, these programming languages are very complimentary to each other and are OFTEN used together to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience on websites. So it is not a question of which one to use, but instead, how to make them work together in the best possible way. Answering THAT question in new and better ways is something that many programmers get paid to do everyday :)</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I am just briefly giving an overview of the main topic and there are MANY sub topics within that main one.  A good starting point to learning about these technologies would be HTTP. ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</a></
