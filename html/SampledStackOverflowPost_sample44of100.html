<a<p>In boolean terms, a majority gate is true if more than half it's inputs are true. ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_function" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_function</a></p>

<p>If you think about it those simple terms than the 3 input example is fairly simple. There are only 3 situations that will result in a true.</p>

<p>(X AND Y) OR (Y AND Z) OR (X AND Z)</p>

<p>You may want to extend that to an arbitrary number of inputs and that is what the equation is for. My verilog is fairly rusty so I don't remember right off but I think that you can do that kind of math with binary inputs if you so choose.</
