<a<p>here are some hints:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You don't need to use characters</strong>,
much less file i/o for this problem
(unless you forgot to state that a
file must be created).</li>
<li>Therefore, <strong>use math to find your statistics</strong>. There are lots of ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" rel="nofollow noreferrer">resources on Fibonacci numbers</a> that might provide a simplifying insight or at least a way to independently spot check your answers.<br>

<ul>
<li>Here is a complicated hint in non-Fortran lingo:
<br><code>floor(10^(frac(log_10(7214989861293412))))</code><br>
(Put this in <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wolfram Alpha</a> to see what it does.)<br></li>
<li>A simpler hint (for a different approach) is that you can do very
well in Fortran with simple
arithmetic inside of looping
constructs--at least for a first pass at the solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Accumulate your statistics as you
go</strong>. This advice would even apply to your character-driven approach. (This problem is ideally suited
for coming up with a cute indexing
scheme for your statistics, but some
people hate cute schemes in
programming. If you don't fear
cuteness ... then you can have associative
arrays in Fortran as long as your
keys are integers ;-)</li>
<li><strong>The most important aspect of this
problem is the data type you will
use</strong> to calculate your answers. For
example, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=calculate+the+1476+Fibonacci+number" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here's the last number you
will have to print</a>.</li>
</ol>
