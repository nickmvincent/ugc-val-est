<a<p>There are 2^20 different possible random values.  Thus, the probability of two given random values being equal is 1/(2^20), or about <strong>1 in a million</strong>.</p>

<p>However, if you are creating multiple values, then due to the ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" rel="nofollow">birthday paradox</a> you will only need to generate about 2^10 or about <strong>one thousand different values</strong> to have a 50% chance of two of them being equal!</p>

<p>To avoid this, I would recommend at least 128-bits.  This requires about 2^64 (~18 billion billion) values before having a 50% chance of collision.  When encoded into base-64, this would be 22-characters long.</
