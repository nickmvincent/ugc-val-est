<p>According to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> you need to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol" rel="nofollow">RTMP</a> to stream from Amazon. Looks like FlowPlayer needs to be <a href="http://flowplayer.org/documentation/configuration/streaming.html" rel="nofollow">configured to use a RTMP plugin</a>. Maybe this will help ;-)</p>
