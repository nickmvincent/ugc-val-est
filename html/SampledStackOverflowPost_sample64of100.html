<p>I think this is the assignment problem again. Each user is a job that needs doing. For each cell tower, create a number of workers according to its capacity. The list of cell towers a user can connect to tells you which worker can do which jobs without incurring a penalty. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem</a> tells you how to solve this/minimize the penalty with e.g. the Hungarian algorithm.</p>
