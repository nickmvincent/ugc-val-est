<a<p>Wikipedia has an article on ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters" rel="nofollow">box-drawing characters</a>.</p>

<p>Since ─ (U+2500) didn't work for you, it's unlikely ━ (U+2501) will work either, but it's perhaps worth a shot. There is also no guarantee that there won't be spaces between these characters, given that spaces appear between underscores.</p>

<p>The issue is not Windows CE supporting Unicode but finding a font that you can use that has the box-drawing characters. Given the likely size limitations (fonts with lots of characters are tens of megabytes big), this might be a challenge.</
