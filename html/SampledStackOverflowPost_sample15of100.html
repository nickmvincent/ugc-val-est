<a<p>I recommend looking at an ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Lexicographical_order_generation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">algorithm for generating permutations in lexicographical order</a>, which is how I recently solved <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=24" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Problem 24</a>.  When the number of items in the array grows large, it becomes expensive to store and sort permutations later on.  </p>

<p>It looks like <code>List::Permutor</code>, which was suggested by Manni, generates numerically sorted permutations.  That's what I'd go with using Perl.  Let us know how it turns out.</
