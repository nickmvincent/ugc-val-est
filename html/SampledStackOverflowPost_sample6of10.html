<a<p>I did something very similar to this a while back, and examined the various options available. I wanted to be able to update the diagram in real time on an AJAX page, and ended up generating and modifying a ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SVG</a> graphic with Javascript code. Firefox handled the resulting page extremely well and responsively, and I wasn't that worried that IE didn't cope with it at all.</p>

<p>Since then, we have had more developments with ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTML5</a> and in particular the new ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_%28HTML_element%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">canvas tag</a>. This sounds to be ideal for this sort of thing, and might be worth an experiment.</p>

<p>Good luck!
