<a<p>I just ran into the same issue, and checking the ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile" rel="nofollow">wikipedia entry for Quartile</a>, it's a bit more complex than it first appears.  </p>

<p>My approach was as follows: (which seems to work pretty well for all cases, N=1 on up)...</p>

<pre><code> /// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Return the quartile values of an ordered set of doubles
///   assume the sorting has already been done.
///   
/// This actually turns out to be a bit of a PITA, because there is no universal agreement 
///   on choosing the quartile values. In the case of odd values, some count the median value
///   in finding the 1st and 3rd quartile and some discard the median value. 
///   the two different methods result in two different answers.
///   The below method produces the arithmatic mean of the two methods, and insures the median
///   is given it's correct weight so that the median changes as smoothly as possible as 
///   more data ppints are added.
///    
/// This method uses the following logic:
/// 
/// ===If there are an even number of data points:
///    Use the median to divide the ordered data set into two halves. 
///    The lower quartile value is the median of the lower half of the data. 
///    The upper quartile value is the median of the upper half of the data.
///    
/// ===If there are (4n+1) data points:
///    The lower quartile is 25% of the nth data value plus 75% of the (n+1)th data value.
///    The upper quartile is 75% of the (3n+1)th data point plus 25% of the (3n+2)th data point.
///    
///===If there are (4n+3) data points:
///   The lower quartile is 75% of the (n+1)th data value plus 25% of the (n+2)th data value.
///   The upper quartile is 25% of the (3n+2)th data point plus 75% of the (3n+3)th data point.
/// 
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
