<p>This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a>. It's the standard interpretation of a universal quantification, i.e. a</p>

<pre><code>collection.all? { |x| some_predicate(x) }
</code></pre>

<p>over an empty <code>collection</code>, but it's known to strike people as counter-intuitive when they first see it in a formal setting. One nice way to think about why this is the preferred semantics is to think about how you would implement <code>all?</code>.</p>

<p>To make your test require that the array is non-empty, just do</p>

<pre><code>array.any? &amp;&amp; array.all? { |x| x == 2 }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>array.any?</code> is fast no matter how large the array, whereas <code>array.all? { |x| x == 2 }</code> can be slow, depending on how big <code>array</code> is and how rare <code>2</code> is in it.  So put the <code>array.any?</code> first.</p>

<p>Also note, there are degenerate cases where this won't work, for instance if <code>array</code> is <code>[nil]</code> or <code>[false]</code>.  If cases like this might come up, replace <code>array.any?</code> with <code>array.any? { true }</code>.</p>
