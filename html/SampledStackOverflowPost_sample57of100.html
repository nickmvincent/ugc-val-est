<p>"The only essential difference between XHTML and HTML is that XHTML must be well-formed XML, while HTML need not be."</p>

<p>It's up to you which one you choose. There is no real difference in terms of what the user sees. Whichever you choose, please try to make it well-formed and make sure that your HTML/XHTML validates and follows the standards. </p>
