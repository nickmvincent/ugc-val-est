<p>The reason is that C/C++ switch statement takes an int argument and do not support string as a type. Although it supports the notion of constant array. Also to mention that C/C++ switch statements are typically generated as <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table" rel="nofollow">branch tables.</a></strong> and it is not easy to generate a branch table using a <code>string</code> style switch.</p>

<p>In C++ the switch statement takes <code>int</code> as the argument.</p>

<p><strong>Why you cannot string in switch and getting the below error?</strong></p>

<pre><code>basic.cpp:42:28: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar]
                case 'A': case 'a': case 'add': case 'Add':
                                         ^
basic.cpp:42:40: warning: multi-character character constant [-Wmultichar]
                case 'A': case 'a': case 'add': case 'Add':
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is because to generate the code for switch the compiler must understand what it means for two values to be equal. For int and enum, it is trivial and easy as they are constant values. But when it comes to string then it is difficult resulting in error.</p>
