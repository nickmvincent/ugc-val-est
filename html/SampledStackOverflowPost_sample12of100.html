<a<p>If you by <em>"the sorted array has the same elements"</em> mean that the sorted array has the some number of occurrences for each element, then those two tests are sufficient. (An array such as <code>{ 1, 1, 2 }</code> should not be a valid result for the input <code>{2, 1, 2}</code>.) Another way of expressing it is that the result should be a permutation of the input.</p>

<p>A third requirement which may or may not interest you is whether or not the algorithm is ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm" rel="nofollow"><strong>stable</strong></a>. In that case you should add a test that makes sure that any two equal elements in the input have the same relative order in the output.</
