<p>Yes, this is possible, at least on many processors.  The key is the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_performance_counter" rel="nofollow"><em>hardware performance counters</em></a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there's a good API for accessing these.  But tools such as <a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/" rel="nofollow"><em>OProfile</em></a> can do this kind of performance monitoring for you.</p>
