TIL I learned about Andy Sidaris. "Sidaris was best known for his series of B-movies produced between 1985 and 1998 specializing in action flicks featuring buxom gun-toting Playboy Playmates and Penthouse Pets with titles like Fit to Kill and Savage Beach.", badMovies, 2016-04-18 02:26:46+00:00, Andy_Sidaris
