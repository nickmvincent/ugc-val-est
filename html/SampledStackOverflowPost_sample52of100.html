<a<p>The compiler is embedding information that is useful for debuggers. This information is by default in the ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF" rel="nofollow">dwarf</a> format.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24457_01/html/E22003/dwarfdump.1.html" rel="nofollow">dwarfdump</a> command to extract this information for the binary files. If you compare the output generated for each file, you'll see that the directory where the original binary was compiled is stored in a couple of location in the dwarf header, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># diff */*.dwarf
9c9
&lt;                     DW_AT_comp_dir              "/tmp/temp1/"
---
&gt;                     DW_AT_comp_dir              "/tmp/temp2/"
29c29
&lt;    2:  N_CMDLINE 0x0,0x0,0x0  "/tmp/temp1/; /opt/solarisstudio12.4/bin/CC  ../a.c"
---
&gt;    2:  N_CMDLINE 0x0,0x0,0x0  "/tmp/temp2/; /opt/solarisstudio12.4/bin/CC  ../a.c"
</code></pre>

<p>Stripping the binary (<code>strip a.out</code>) should remove that header and make both compiled files identical.</p>

<p>Should you use an older release of the compiler or use the <code>-xdebugformat=stabs</code> compiler option, the debugging information would have been stored in ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabs" rel="nofollow">stabs</a> format instead of dwarf. In such case, the command to extract it is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24457_01/html/E22003/dumpstabs.1.html" rel="nofollow">dumpstabs</a> and would find similar differences related to the compilation directory, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>.stabs "/tmp/temp1/; /opt/solarisstudio12.4/bin/CC -xdebugformat=stabs  ../a.c",N_CMDLINE,0x0,0x0,0x0
</code></pr
