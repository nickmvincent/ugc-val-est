<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing</a> gives the equivalent problem of determining whether there are k subsets, out of a collection of given subsets of a universal set of N elements, such that none of the k chosen subsets intersect. The maximization problem is obvious and can be solved in polynomial time if the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time: The maximization problem asks for the maximum k such that k subsets can be found such that none of the k subsets intersect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these problems are NP-hard (specifically, the decision problem for specific k is NP-complete), so unless P = NP, there is no universal fast solution for your problem. Maybe given the low number of rows and columns in your problem, a "fast enough" solution can be devised. However based on my initial reading of the classical set packing problem, it's not clear how such a solution would work.</p>
