<a<p>To keep the vast majority of users from reading your files you can use the 16th century cipher ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher" rel="nofollow">"Vigen√®re"</a>. Choose any byte string <code>key</code> and encrypt/decrypt via</p>

<pre><code>byte [] encryptOrDecrypt(byte[] key, byte[] input){
    byte [] result = new byte[input.length];
    for(int i=0; i&lt;input.length; i++) {
        result[i] = input[i] ^ key[i % key.length];
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Warning: I have not run this code, it probably contains a bunch of syntax errors.)</p>

<p>You are out of luck, though, if you try to protect against a dedicated attacker. In the end one can always reverse engineer your apk file. So whatever kind of cryptography you are using, if your program can read the file, so can a dedicated attacker.</
