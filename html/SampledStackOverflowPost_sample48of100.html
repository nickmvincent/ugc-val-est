<a<p>There is the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/" rel="nofollow">websockets API</a>, but it is not supported on all browsers. The latest draft is supported by Chrome 14, Firefox 7 and Internet Explorer 10. If this is for development only, and you use on of those browsers, that shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>This API will allow the server to contact the client as well as the other way around, so no polling needed anymore. See also the ***<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia page</a> for an introduction.</
