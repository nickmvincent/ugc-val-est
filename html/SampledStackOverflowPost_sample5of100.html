<p>You should use django-piston to create RESTful APIs and make an AJAX call from your page to delete your django objects.</p>

<p>You can read about RESTful here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer</a></p>

<p>and django-piston here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home</a></p>

<p>I've heard that you could achieve this with Generic Views starting django version 1.3, but I haven't used it.</p>
