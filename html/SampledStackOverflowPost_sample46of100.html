<p>Osborn's Law: "Osborn's Law: Variables won't; constants aren't." :)</p>

<p>Wikipedia has entries for both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming)" rel="noreferrer">programming variables</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)" rel="noreferrer">mathematical variables</a></p>

<p>Variables in most programming languages are mutable - they are buckets that can hold a piece of information with a symbolic name for a period of time.</p>

<p>In functional languages, such as XQuery or XSLT, they cannot be changed once assigned. The same is true of <code>final</code> variables in Java, or <code>const</code> variables in most programming languages.</p>
