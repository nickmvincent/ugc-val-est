<a<p>Have you tried ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DFS</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Run DFS for every vertex in the graph as source
    If a visited vertex is encountered again, the graph is not singly connected
repeat for every unvisited vertex.
The graph is singly connected.
</code></pre>

<p>Complexity O(v^2), o(v) dfs as no repetition.</
