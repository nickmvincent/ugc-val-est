<p>If the remaining byte is 0x9A, the file is not proper UTF-8, nor is the tool you are using to view it (0x9A is š in e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252" rel="nofollow">Windows codepage 1252</a>) nor apparently your <code>tr</code>.</p>

<p>To properly solve your problem, we would need to see a fragment of the actual bytes in the file.  For example, a file displaying as <code>åäö</code> could contain the bytes</p>

<pre><code>0xE5 0xE4 0xF6
</code></pre>

<p>if it's in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" rel="nofollow">ISO-8859-1</a> (which coincides with CP1252 in these positions) or</p>

<pre><code>0xC3 0xA5 0xC3 0xA4 0xC3 0xB6
</code></pre>

<p>if it was proper UTF-8.  On OSX, an old file could also plausibly be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman" rel="nofollow">Mac Roman</a> which would encode this string as</p>

<pre><code>0x8C 0x81 0x9A
</code></pre>

<p>as well as, of course, a large number of other encodings, depending on the file's provenance.</p>
