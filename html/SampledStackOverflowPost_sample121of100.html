<p>Use <strong><a href="http://directory.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Apache Directory Server</a></strong>, which is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP" rel="nofollow">LDAP</a>-standard implementation.</p>

<p>You can manage the directory database using <strong><a href="http://directory.apache.org/studio/" rel="nofollow">Apache Directory Studio</a></strong> so it's quite user friendly (or at least, admin-friendly).</p>

<p>Then you can hook the directory programmatically to any application that requires access to the credentials, LDAP client libraries are widely available on popular programming platforms such as Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, etc.</p>
