<a<p>It depends on what you are trying to do. ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern" rel="nofollow">If your game engine is composition based, that may be a solution</a> (I mean each game object is not defined by its class name but rather by the objects that compose it, and you can interact with those objects). You can also register them all in the Scene and be able to fetch them by name, or getting an array of existent by type (using template methods, for example). You can also use the ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" rel="nofollow">Observer pattern</a>: each game object implements an interface providing a service, and other game objects subscribe to that service, and are updated when the values of that other object is updated. There are tons of valid solutions, I'm just contributing with some more. It really depends on what you want to take out from the interactions between the objects.</
