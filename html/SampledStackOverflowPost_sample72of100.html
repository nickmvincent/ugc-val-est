<p>The <code>? :</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:" rel="nofollow"><strong>ternary operator</strong></a>. It was invented to simplify stuff like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (booleanExpression) {
    var x = expression1;
} else {
    var x = expression2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the above would become:</p>

<pre><code>var x = booleanExpression ? expression1: expression2;
</code></pre>

<p>They are equivalent but using the ternary operator is a bit more concise. I've mostly seen this used for conditional assignment or just making an <code>if-else</code> clause more compact/require fewer keystrokes. In the example you gave, I would imagine it is used for conditionally reversing some collection based on an argument or flag provided to the module. </p>
