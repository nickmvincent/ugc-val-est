<p>Python's built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code></a> module loads and dumps entire objects, so you can't do it directly with that. There are event-driven (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML" rel="nofollow">"SAX style"</a>) JSON parsers available, for example <a href="http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/" rel="nofollow">yajl</a>, which has <a href="http://pykler.github.com/yajl-py/" rel="nofollow">Python bindings</a>.</p>

<p>Personally I try not to use 3rd-party dependencies unless I have to, so I'd probably go with manually printing the beginning/end/keys and using the built-in JSON module. Or just keep the whole thing in memory. How much memory does it actually take? Remember to only optimize once you've profiled and found it to be a problem. :-)</p>
