  <p>My real question is what happens when the cache grows so large</p>

<p>This is where you would implement a sort of Garbage Collection. Items could be removed from the cache following a ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms" rel="nofollow">Cache Algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>So for example following Least Recently Used you would record how many times a specific object was used when it was last accessed and remove those from the cache that were not used recently.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Soundcloud use an object store and a very interesting read is <a href="http://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/building-the-next-soundcloud" rel="nofollow">this article</a> on how they built their webapp.</
