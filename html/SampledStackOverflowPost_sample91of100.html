<p>Your projection looks like an extreme wide-angle view.  It's a "correct" perspective projection - your formula is the right one, but the key is in the <code>scale</code> variable/constant.</p>

<p>The value for <code>scale</code> is generally</p>

<pre><code>screen_width_in_pixels * focal_length
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>focal_length</code> is the ratio of the distance from the viewer's eyes from the screen, to the width of the screen.  Of course you can't control how close someone sits in front of their monitor, so you guess. 1.0 - 1.5 is generally a good range.</p>

<p>When you change that value to something less wide-angle, a side-effect will be that the 'camera' will 'zoom in' on your object, and probably fill up the screen.  So you will need to compensate by moving the object further away from the camera.</p>

<p>There is (of course) a nice long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia article on the subject</a>.</p>
