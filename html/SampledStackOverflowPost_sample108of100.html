<p>MongoDB (including the console) will by default always generate and stores in UTC, however <code>ISODate</code>s do support a timezone offset ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_offsets_from_UTC" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_offsets_from_UTC</a> ) however you would need to manage the creation of that offset from your application.</p>

<p>As @CRUSADER mentions it is normally better to store the users offset within the row or even not at all, particularly if your user could be accessing from many locations with many different timezones. In this case it might actually be better to modify the dates within your client JavaScript to take care of the difference in timezone from where they are currently accessing the page.</p>
