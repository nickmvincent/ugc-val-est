<a<p>Are you saying you can successfully send and read the image if you sent it from Android to your Linux machine? If not then it sounds like it could be an ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" rel="nofollow">Endian</a> issue, if your Linux Server process was not written in Java.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Since cnicutar has a great answer I'd like to offer an alternative to having to do your protocol manually.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/" rel="nofollow">Google Protocol Buffer</a></p>

<p>When using it, it will automatically convert from host to network and back. It also can be used to create C++ and Java bindings.</
