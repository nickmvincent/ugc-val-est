<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Cookie_attributes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beside the name/value pair, a cookie
  may also contain an expiration date, a
  path, a domain name, and whether the
  cookie is intended only for encrypted
  connections. RFC 2965 also specifies
  that cookies must have a mandatory
  version number, but this is usually
  omitted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the version number, if there is one</li>
<li>Check the expiration date, assuming it's being set based on current time + some amount</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I know, that's all you can do. If you're involved in setting the cookie, you can put the information you need into one of the properties above when you set it.</p>
