<a<p>This isn't so much a compiler as an interpreter/designer. But I digress.</p>

<p>Basically what you are being asked to create is a "drawing command language", and a program that can interpret that command language. For an example of what a "drawing command language" is usually expected to do, take a look at ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" rel="nofollow">LOGO</a>.</p>

<p>What you are required to do is to define a simple set of instructions (primitives) that will, in the proper combination, cause a shape to be drawn. You will also have to include a primitive to rotate the shape. ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_primitive#Interpreted_language_primitives" rel="nofollow">Here's the Wikipedia definition of "primitive" in the appropriate context.</a> By doing this, you are creating a "language" and a "runtime"; theoretically you could save the commands in a file, then re-load them into the program and re-run them to generate the same shape.</p>

<p>There are three major ways you could go with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Define primitives to draw different types of lines (straight, curved, solid, dashed, etc etc) and set the color with which to draw the next line(s). This would likely have you creating primitives just to create primitives; your main primitives will be "Set Color" and "Draw Line".</p></li>
<li><p>Define primitives to draw various pre-defined shapes (line, circle, rectangle, pentagon, hexagon, etc etc). This is probably what your classmates will do, and it's going to both take a while and not be very functional.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement "turtle drawing" much like LOGO. There would be a cursor (the "turtle") that is represented on-screen somehow, and its current location and where it goes is integral to the drawing of lines.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I like the last idea; you'll need primitives to move the turtle, to mark the start and end positions of lines, set colors, rotate, clear, etc:</p>

<ul>
<li>MVUP x - Move turtle up by x pixels </li>
<li>MVDN x - Move turtle down by x pixels </li>
<li>MVLT x - Move turtle left by x pixels </li>
<li>MVRT x - Move turtle right by x pixels </li>
<li>SETC r g b - Set the line-drawing color to an RGB value </li>
<li>STLN - Mark the start of a line at the turtle's position</li>
<li>ENDL - Mark the end of a line at the turtle's position; causes the line to be drawn from start to end using the currently-set color. </li>
<li>RTCL x - Rotate canvas x degrees clockwise (this requires some matrix math, and you will lose anything you've drawn that falls outside the canvas after rotation)</li>
<li>RTCC x - Rotate canvas x degrees counter-clockwise (ditto)</li>
<li>CNTR - Place turtle in the very center of the canvas. Useful when defining an initial position from which to begin, or to avoid reversing a number of complex movements to get back to the center and draw again.</li>
<li>CLRS - Remove all drawn lines from the pad. This, along with CNTR, should probably be the first two commands in a "program" to draw any particular shape, but if you omit them, the program can build on itself iteratively by being run on top of its previous output to create fractal patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just gave you 11 primitive commands that could be used to move a cursor from place to place on a canvas, drawing lines as you go, and could draw any 2D shape the user wished. You could also use a forward-backward-turn left-turn right model, as if the turtle were a robot, but that would probably make this more complex than it has to be (remember YAGNI; it will serve you well in industry).</p>

<p>Once you have the language, you have to make it work 2 ways; first, the program has to know how to interpret the instructions entered in a textbox in order to draw/redraw the shape on a drawing pad, and second, the program has to accept mouse input on the drawing pad, interpret those commands as moving the turtle/marking start or end/setting colors, and enter the commands into the textbox. That's your project, and I leave its implementation to you.</
