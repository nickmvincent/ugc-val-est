<p>Subclasses should have the same or stricter [preconditions, post conditions and invariants] than their parent classes. This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" rel="nofollow">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>. So, you should not re-enable copy construction etc/whatever in the derived class, since you will be loosening the contract of the base class.</p>

<p>If you find you need to do it (or would really like to do it), then it may be a sign that you need to rethink your design.</p>
