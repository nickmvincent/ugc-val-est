<a<p>Yes it can be useful to use assert to verify the correctness of your program run-time. I would typically use it to catch errors according to the ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast" rel="nofollow">fail-fast principle</a> to actively detect bugs. </p>

<p>A typical use case would be that an operation succeeded. Consider the following sample: </p>

<pre><code>int nChanges = database.update(..);
assert(nChanges == 1);
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't consider using it for parameter validation or any such operation which should be validated in regular code according to the contract, since it doesn't throw the appropriate exceptions (and run-time exceptions can be mean). Similarly I wouldn't use it in testing since JUnit already offers assert mechanisms which in contrast to regular assert statements cannot be disabled. </
