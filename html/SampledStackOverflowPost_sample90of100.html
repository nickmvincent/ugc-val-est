<p>Good question.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model#EAV_versus_row_modeling" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia article</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The differences between row modeling and EAV are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A row-modeled table is homogeneous in the facts that it describes: a Line Items table describes only products sold. By contrast, an EAV table contains almost any type of fact.</li>
  <li>The data type of the value column/s in a row-modeled table is pre-determined by the nature of the facts it records. By contrast, in an EAV table, the conceptual data type of a value in a particular row depend on the attribute in that row.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So here's my take on that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>row modelling</p>

<pre><code>create table line_items (
  id int primary key,
  sale_id int,
  foreign key sale_id references sale(id),
  product_name varchar(50), -- this could also be a foreign key 
  price decimal(10, 2)
);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>this has some type safety:  <code>price</code> can't be some junk string</p></li>
<li><p>the only things that we put in this table are line items</p></li>
<li><p>to me, this sounds just like a normal 1:many relationship (but I'm not sure so don't quote me on that)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>entity-attribute-value</p>

<pre><code>create table my_eav (
  entity_id int,
  foreign key (entity_id) references entity(id),
  attribute varchar(50),
  value varchar(50),
  primary key (entity_id, attribute)
);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>the values are stored as <code>varchar</code>s -- but they could be numbers, strings, times, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>all kinds of data can be stored -- shoe size, airplane weight, the number of home runs Babe Ruth hit in 1926</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The article goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The circumstances where you would need to go beyond standard row-modeling to EAV are listed below:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The data types of individual attributes varies (as seen with clinical findings).</li>
  <li>The categories of data are numerous, growing or fluctuating, but the number of instances (records/rows) within each category is very small. Here, with conventional modeling, the database’s entity–relationship diagram might have hundreds of tables: the tables that contain thousands/ millions of rows/instances are emphasized visually to the same extent as those with very few rows. The latter are candidates for conversion to an EAV representation.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you have a lot of these 1:many relationships, do you want to have 1 table for each, as row modelling requires?  Whereas EAV would allow you to combine (some or all of) those tables into 1.</p>
