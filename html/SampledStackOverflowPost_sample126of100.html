<p>You're doing it all wrong.</p>

<p>Fill an array with all of your range of numbers from smallest to largest.</p>

<p>Use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle" rel="nofollow">Fisher/Yates/Knuth shuffle</a> to mix the array.</p>

<p>Draw out as many numbers as you need.</p>

<p>(No code included on purpose because I didn't fix your problem)</p>
