<a<p>This is not an answer really but its a starter and I might add more to it:</p>

<p>The cell ids are published it seems:</p>

<p>I found this link from this wiki page that has links to other cell id data sources: ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_ID" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_ID</a> )</p>

<p>see the bottom of the page the is a link to the cell id data:</p>

<p>also i found this youtube video where a guys is playing around with some apps that have cell tower locations it seems:</p>

<p>possibly between the cell ids and signal strength you can make a guess..</p>

<p>but AFAIK for general triangulation you need to know the exact location of at least three towers and your exact distance from them (this could be a rough distance with signal strength but it may just be too in accurate).</p>

<p>it seems like wikipedia is saying its done in this way.. use a combination of which cell you are in, the closest tower and signal strengths to get your location:</p>
