<a<p>The general class of problem is called "***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">secret sharing</a>". In this instance, one solution would be to encrypt the file with a single key K, then generate and attach three encrypted versions of K, each encrypted by one combination of two DKs. (I assume that all DKs can be derived from MK.)</p>

<p>Note that questions like these, which are more about cryptographic protocols than about programming, would probably be better asked on <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/">crypto</a>.</
