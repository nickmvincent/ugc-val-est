<a<p>What you need is a proper data structure. From your requirement description, I think ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" rel="nofollow">trie</a> is just the one.</p>

<p>You build a trie with a list of colors and then search the trie with user inputs (prefix is allowed).
You can find diverse implementations on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=trie%20python&amp;ref=commandbar" rel="nofollow">github</a> or implement it yourself. :)</
