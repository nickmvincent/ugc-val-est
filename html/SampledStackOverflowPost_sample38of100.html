<a<p>It is perfectly fine to list a bunch of classes to remove.  It will just remove the ones that are present and not cause any errors.  That is an acceptable way to do what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>FYI, this is a place where chaining simplifies your code a bit too:</p>

<pre><code>$("#fullbg").removeClass('image2 image3').addClass('image1');
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Since you have a lot of copied code in your current implementation, it's probably better the ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow">DRY</a> up the whole implementation with just one common event handler:</p>

<pre><code>$("#fullbg a").click(function() {
    var num = $(this).index() + 1;
    $("#fullbg").removeClass('image1 image2 image3').addClass('image' + num);
});
</code></pr
