<p>You can use recursion no problem, but if the recursion never terminates or simply goes too deep (the depth of the stack has a set limit that you're not allowed to exceed), you'll get the error you're seeing. It's not a CPU usage issue.  If it's the former problem, you obviously need to fix it so it will end.  If it's the latter, see here for a solution:</p>
