<p>What you are basically asking is: "given a value y, find an x, such that h(x)=y."
This is called finding a pre-image.
The whole of point of one-way-hashing-functions (of which SHA1 is one example) is that this is not possible in any way that is faster than brute force (which would take an average of O(2^159) actions).</p>
