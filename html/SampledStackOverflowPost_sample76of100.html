<p>HBase does not support transaction.
While you have something around atomicity on single table you've got noting like transaction if you need to update more than one.
Transactions means 4 things that go by the acronym <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow">ACID</a>. in a nutshell </p>

<ul>
<li>Atomicity - changes in a transaction occur together ("all or nothing").</li>
<li>Consistency - state should remain valid </li>
<li>Isolation - operations outside the transaction cannot see half-changes (intermediate inconsistent states)</li>
<li>Durability  - changes should persist</li>
</ul>

<p>You'd have to change HBase code to get Isolation but if you can relax that requirement  you can implement a transaction coordinator that would roughly do something like</p>

<ul>
<li>save what needs to be done in the transaction in a special table (transaction log)</li>
<li>perform first change</li>
<li>perform second change</li>
<li>verify that the steps where done and mark the transaction as completed</li>
<li>when recovering go to the transaction log and complete/rollback changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that because you don't have isolation sometimes rolling back is not an option so you'd need to implement compensation logic (also take a look at the <a href="http://rgoarchitects.bit.ly/4xNwpp" rel="nofollow">saga pattern</a>)</p>
