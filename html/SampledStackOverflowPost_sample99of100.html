<a<p>You actually are talking about user authentication, believe it or not.</p>

<p>That's user authentication - it's just that the "user" is the application calling your APIs.</p>

<p>If OAuth isn't enough to do everything you need (and it might, you should check!), you shouldn't start adding yet another custom authentication method to HTTPS. Instead, stand on the shoulders of giants and use ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" rel="nofollow">Basic Authentication</a>, because <em>that's what it's for</em>. Your tools, sysadmins and API clients will thank you for it.</
