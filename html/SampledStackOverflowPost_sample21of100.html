<p>SQL Server will stop executing the query and rollback any open transactions.  That rollback will undo any changes that haven't been fully committed.  Since SQL Server adheres to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow">ACID</a> principle, you shouldn't be able to leave your database in a bad state, even by killing SPIDs.  That isn't to say you couldn't leave your data in a bad state, i.e. not wrapping multiple operations in a transaction to enforce consistency upon failure.</p>
