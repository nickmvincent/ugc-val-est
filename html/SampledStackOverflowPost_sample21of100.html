<a<p>See this article about the PRG pattern: ***<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get</a></p>

<p>In short, after the user POSTs (submits) data to your server, you issue a Response.Redirect to have the users browser GET a page. This way, if the user presses the reload button, it is the GET request that is repeated.</
