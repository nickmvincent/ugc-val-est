Explaining SO and reddit

Explaining methodology

We used the same process to answer the three research questions. Each RQ is subdivided into two parts: investigating the actual effect (i.e. do posts that link to Wikipedia articles have higher scores) and investigating whether there is a causal relationship. Therefore, in each case we select measurements relevant to the RQ, compare the descriptive stats, and then perform a causal analysis with two different models. For causal analysis, we use a propensity score stratification approach (first described in [CITE] and used in the context of HCI in various cases [a, b, c, d]) in addition to a covariate nearest neighbors matching approach.
We believe the platforms we study are particularly well-suited to the use of propensity scores and covariate matching because the platform are extremely transparent - we have access to almost all information about user behavior on the platform. This allows us to make a plausible case for causality, as our modeling approach addresses most plausible confounders. We discuss this in greater detail below, and also offer some discussion about possible confounders that were not accounted for by our model.

RQ1 and RQ2 use the same output metrics. To answer these questions, we are interested in measurements that correspond to the value a single post adds to the platform. We identify two distinct parts of the platform that receive value from content on the platform. The private companies that own the platforms receive economic value through increased revenue, and increased opportunities for revenue and funding (i.e. pageviews lead to additional advertising revenue, and increased user engagement can lead to better advertising prices or better investment opportunities). <BAD> The users of the platform receive value from content in the form of better consumable content (i.e. programming answers on SO and various media on reddit).

In answering RQ1 and RQ2 we focus on the following metrics: the score (equal to upvotes minus downvotes) that an item receives, the number of comments that an item receives, and the total number of items that appear on the platform. Since Stack Overflow provides access to pageview data (last updated May 2, 2017 [cite BigQuery]), we also use the pageviews an item receives as an output metric. This is the metric that lets us make the most accurate economic
